Requirements

Visual Studio 2010, at least [Express][vs]
[Windows 7 x64 SDK][winsdk] for x64 systems
[Git][git] installed and [ssh][ssh] configured (ssh for development only)

Installation
------------

Requirements (see https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp):

`cd` to the project root and run

``` bash

Npm will then start loading the dependencies and configuration scripts will take care of manual dependency builds.
